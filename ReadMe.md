# Documentation of Carousel Project

## Project Overview
This assignment is a customizable and interactive carousel designed to display a dynamic collection of cards in a sleek and user-friendly manner. The carousel is ideal for showcasing items such as books, products, or images, while supporting seamless navigation and responsiveness.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Fetches book information, including titles, descriptions, and images, from a JSON file (`book-description.json`).
- **Smooth Navigation**: Includes arrow buttons, keyboard shortcuts, and rotating functionality for easy browsing.
- **Pagination Indicators**: Dots below the carousel show the current position.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes
